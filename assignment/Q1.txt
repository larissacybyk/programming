Q1:

1. Notes on data scientists:
  - median salary: 108,020
  - education: bachelor's (math, stat, CS, etc)
  - 36% employment growth
2. (in spreadsheet)
3. I was suprised to see how high the employment growth was for data scientists compared to other jobs.
4. best to worst:
computer and information research scientist
data scientist
software developer
computer hardware engineer
aerospace engineer
mathematician
statistician
project management specialist
architect

I ranked these in this order based off of a combination of the highest median salaries and the predicted employment growth. If they were fairly similar in data, I ranked them based off how difficult they seem and how interested I would be in them.
